Estimating marine survival of Atlantic salmon using an inverse matrix approach
=====

This repository contains all the R code for the analyses and figures for the
manuscript titled "Estimating marine survival of Atlantic salmon using an
inverse matrix approach" by Sebasti√°n A. Pardo and Jeffrey A. Hutchings,
currently under review in PLOS ONE.

To recreate the simulation, SIR algorirthm, and figures, run the files in the `analysis/` folder 
sequentially. This will populate the `figures/` and `data/` folders with the simulations' outputs.
These two folders are not under version control, which is why they're empty in the repository.
