Estimating marine survival of Atlantic salmon using an inverse matrix approach
=====

This repository contains all the R code for the analyses and figures for the
manuscript titled "Estimating marine survival of Atlantic salmon using an
inverse matrix approach" by Sebasti√°n A. Pardo and Jeffrey A. Hutchings,
currently under review in PLOS ONE.

To recreate the simulation, SIR algorirthm, and figures, run the files in the `analysis/` folder 
sequentially, or use the Makefile. This will populate the `figures/` and `data/` folders with 
the simulations' outputs.
These two folders are not under version control, which is why they're empty in the repository.

### Using the Makefile

To simulate the data:

```sh
make fish
```

To run the sample-importance-resampling algorithm:

```sh
make sir
```

To recreate the figures and LaTeX tables:

```sh
make figs
```

To run the Supporting Information analysis for a declining population and recreate the figures:

```sh
make supp
```
